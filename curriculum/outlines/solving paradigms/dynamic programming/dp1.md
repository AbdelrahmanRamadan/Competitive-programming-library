## Outline
1. DP Illustration
    1. Problems solving paradigms.
    2. States, transitions, optimal substructure and recurrences.
        * least-cost airline fare: problem with no optimal substructure (Best from A-B is A-C-B but best from A-C is A-D-C)
    3. Example recurrences.
        * Problem "Rod cutting" - CLRS 15.1
        * Problem "Wedding Shopping" - UVa 11450
        * fibonacci
        * "knapsack" problem
        * "coin change" problem
    4. solution approaches
        * Gready, backtracking or compelte search, bruteforce, divide and conquer
    5. Repeated states and Memoization.
2. different perspectives (more than one valid recurrence for the same problem)
    1. "Rod cutting" another reccurence
    2. "coin change" another reccurence
3. session problems
    1. 
    2. 
    3. maximum path in grid (left & down directions)
    4. longest increasing subsequence
    5. longest common subsequence
    6. longest palindromic subsequence
    7. 
4. Tricks and Pitfalls.
5. Writing codes
